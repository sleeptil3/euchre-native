### Terminal Commands

- `yarn install`: install dependancies
- `yarn start`: run the metro server
- `expo build:ios -t archive`: build `.ipa` and upload to Expo account for publish to AppStore
- `expo build:ios -t simulator`: build for local iOS Simulator app

Expo must be installed globally to use those commands. `yarn expo [...]` should also work if not installed globally
