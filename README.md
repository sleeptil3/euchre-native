## About the Project

This was my first foray into React-Native, and I had a blast! What an enjoyable process. The most challenging aspect of this project was building the AI for the computer players as well as the layout design in accomodating various the iPhone screen sizes.

I was so impressed with how well the React-Native and Expo documentation was made. I used Expo's Managed Workflow which does limit you a bit on the external libraries you can use, but I found the ones they included met all my needs for this project.

From start to finish, this project took about 17 days. Most of the game logic was completed on a web-version created the preceding week, however much had to be re-tooled for the Native version.
