# About Euchre Night

Euchre Night was my first foray into developing for iOS using React-Native and a managed workflow on Expo. The most challenging aspect of this project was building the AI for the computer players as well as the UI/UX design and making sure it accomodates the various the iPhone screen sizes, including the notch.

I was very impressed with the React-Native and Expo documentation. Expo's Managed Workflow does limit you a bit on the external libraries you can use, but I found the ones they included met all my needs for this project.

From start to finish, this project took about 17 days, (not counting the copious updates and bug fixes). Most of the game logic was completed on a web-version that was created the preceding week for a hackathon where the prompt was to create a card game, however the majority of the project had to be re-tooled for the Native version, particularly in styling.
