## Privacy Policy

### Data Collection & Sharing

Sleeptil3Software ("**The Developer**") collects no data for internal purposes. However, Euchre Night ("**The App**") was built using React Native via an Expo Managed Workflow, and some of the underlying SDKs require basic device data (the Device ID). **The Developer** does not collect any user data for advertising purposes. For more information on Expo and their privacy practices, [read their policy](https://expo.dev/privacy).

As **The Developer** does not collect any user data, no data is retained.

### Changes To This Privacy Policy

**The Developer** may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Laws, regulations, and industry standards evolve, which may make those changes necessary, or **The Developer** may make changes to their services or business. **The Developer** will post the changes to this page and encourage you to review this Privacy Policy to stay informed. If **The Developer** make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, **The Developer** will provide additional notice through **The App**. If you disagree with the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should remove **The App** from your device.
